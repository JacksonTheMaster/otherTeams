## Histroical Context
This tool was developed back when the old Electron based Microsoft Teams (now called Teams Classic) did not support multiple accounts within the same application. It served as a workaround to allow users to access different Teams accounts simultaneously on the same computer. While Microsoft has since added native multi-account support to WebView2 Teams, this utility *might* still be useful for some die hard legacy Teams Classic users or specific scenarios. Though, I guess, If you work for a company and read this in 2025, is IS probably too late.

[![Download][Download]][download-url]



### Prerequisites

Admin Account on windows device

### Installation

Install the MSI Package (asks for admin perms)
Run the Shortcut in your Startmenu called Teams (type Teams)
Set a username and a Password.


### (User Setup)
(automatically happening)

Setup a user LIKE:
teamsuser
4a11e12e0bba2ce327b1ba9%%%9a0d84
I STRONGLY recomend setting something like teamsbotuser and 32 char string as password, you wont need it ever again.
RESPECT YOUR LOCAL PASSWORD POLICIES!!!
 
Teams is then downloaded and installed i the new user profile. 

When its done, login as usual. 

To open, run the shortcut from the Startmenu. 

### Closing

To kill, close app before closing it from the taskbar icon (in the System drawer, right side taskbar, the little "up" arrow :) )

### Uninstall

Uninstall from Apps menu in Windows as usual

delete creds from C:\Program Files (x86)\teamsothertenant

<!-- ROADMAP & Known issues-->
## Roadmap & Known issues

- [ ] User Management (capable of multiple users)
- [ ] OneLogin seems to be buggy at startup sometimes. 
    - [ ] use the "log out" button teams shows you. Maybe close and restart app. If started, it keeps running for the day.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/jacksonthemaster/otherTeams/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
